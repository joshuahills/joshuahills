# About Me

I'm a Graduate Software Engineer at a distinguished engineering company, currently working on a train station management system. I graduated from Coventry University in 2021 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.
The area of software development I enjoy most is full-stack web development as it requires working in different languages and technologies and provides the most opportunities for me to learn new ones.

# Technologies

As part of my job and various side projects, I have experience using a wide variety of technologies, including:
- Node.js with both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Angular
- React
- HTML and CSS
- .NET and C#
- Python
- SQL
- MongoDB
- Git
- AWS
- Linux

I also have some experience from university in C and C++, Haskell, MATLAB and R. 

# FAQs

**Favourite language?**

TypeScript. It extends JS to a modern OOP language while mantaining the ease of JS, as well of some of its quirks.

**Least favourite language?**

Python. Aside from easy data manipulation and short scripts, any Python projects I've worked on quickly become messy. I also think Python enables and even encourages lazy software development with Pip packages for everything.
